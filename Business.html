        After inheriting the money and his uncle's business, he was set for life. He quit his old job and became the CEO of Duck Corp, the multinational company.
        He had very little knowledge of how to run it so he started to come up with ideas on how to do so.</p>
      <p class="center">
        After a while, he figured out how to take care of the business and decided to expand. He came across an article on how to expand a business and decided to follow the steps.
        While doing so, he came across some challenges. He ran surveys and carried out research on the different markets available. 
        He found a market for duck clothing but he did not know how to start. He disovered a clothing company that was just starting, and took an interest.
        Now he was stuck between starting his own clothing line or investing in the new clothing company.
