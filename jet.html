        The Jet! He bought the jet first. He went for a ride in the jet, right after. The jet was name Duckspeed, and it was painted white and yellow.
        He got a lot of followers on social media because of the jet. People started following him around in public, and he did not like that. 
        He got a call from the company and was told that the company was about to lose a lot of money, so he asked how he could help. He was told to sell the jet,
        and get some of the money back, and he did that.
