        He bought the yacht first. He then hosted a party on the yacht, where a lot of people showed up.

        The business was going well. It became recognized by a lot of people and became one of the top places to have a party on many blog sites. 
        It was going so well, he never got to enjoy the yacht. One day, he decided to stop the business and just go for a cruise. After that cruise, he never hosted another party on the yacht.

        Two months after the business of hosting parties had stopped, he had nothing to do. Every weekend, he would fish or go for a cruise. 
        Life started to get boring for Mr. Duck.
