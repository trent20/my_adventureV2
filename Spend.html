        Mr Duck realized that he was rich. He owned a company, but was not going to show much interest in it.
        He thought to himself, "Why not make use of the money available?".</p>
        <p>
         He decided to buy something luxurious, like a yacht or a jet. 
        The problem with this was that he could not make up his mind, as to which to get first.
