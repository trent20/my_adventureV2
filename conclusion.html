      He realized that he had 1,000,000 dollars left to his name. He also had a business that was left to him. 
      He realized that his uncle had plans for him and decided that he should honor those plans. He discovered new opportunities for his new life. A life that would be anything but simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to work at Duck Corp. He sat in his chair for most of the time. He attended board meetings and signed deals that need to be closed.
      He was living the life of a billionaire and multinational company owner. He was content, but felt that he needed to do more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He created a foundation, naming it "Uncle Duckie's". Through the foundation, he built shelters for the homeless and hosted charity events to help the less fortunate. 
      He then built an orphanage. 
    </p>
    <p>
      After all that, he took a long vacation to an area that was by a lake, and had a beach not too far away. 
      His vacation home was a cabin in the woods, that was surrounded by trees and had a lake nearby.
